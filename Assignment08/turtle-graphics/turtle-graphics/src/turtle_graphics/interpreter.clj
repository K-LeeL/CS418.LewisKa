;; Assignment 08: Terry the Turtle

;;Problem 1
;; We discussed Uncle Bobâ€™s construction of a Turtle Graphics package for Clojure built around the Quil graphics package.
;; Using that package as a starting point, write an interpreter for the turtle graphics language:
;;
;; forward <units>
;; turn <angle>
;; pen <upOrDown>
;;
;;where <units> is the number of units to move forward, <angle> is number of degrees to turn, with negative values indicating
;; turn left that many degrees and positive values saying to turn right that many degrees, and <upOrDown> being the either 1 
;; for pen down or 0 for pen up. You may assume all values are of type double.
